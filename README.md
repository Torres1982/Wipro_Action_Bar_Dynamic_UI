### Technologies used:
1. Android Studio
2. Java
3. XML

### Assessment Description:
Adding the user interface controls at runtime subject to the user selection of the choice of the control to be added to the layout.  
Develop an application to add the controls for the activity at runtime. App should have an activity with *App Bar* which will give 
the options for adding the type of UI control to the activity.

When the app is run, initially, the app has to show a blank activity (with no UI). Activity should be programmed to have an App Bar
to display a set of options for adding the type of the control to the activity. Upon selecting an option, the selected control is to 
be added to the activity. Dynamically create a *Linear Layout* set to vertical orientation option and keep adding the selected 
control to the linear layout.
